# Work Solutions Collection
This is a repository with a collection of code I created as solutions for projects at my workplace.
Each project will be separated into it's own directory as an example of the solution I came up with.

All code has been modified to work for these demos, and are not a direct copy from the original code from work.

## Canvas
The canvas code example is about a feature I've added for the in-house developed CRM. The CRM is for the retail optical
stores, and I've been the lead developer of the CRM. This feature was part of the eye exam chart that the eye doctors
used to mark findings of the eyes on an image.

## MQTT
MQTT is a solution that I came up with for the corporate laboratory sensor array. The sensor array is in-house
developed using Arduino based controllers called Moteino, and the sensor PCB was developed in-house with the purpose
of connecting to the Moteino. The sensor array checks multiple temperatures that are sent to a server for further
processing. MQTT is used to communicate between sensors, servers, and software for display and control of the sensors.
